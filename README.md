# BioProcessML

Welcome to **BioProcessML**, a personal journey into the world of bioprocess modeling! This repository showcases my exploration of advanced machine learning techniques, including Gaussian Processes (GPs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), alongside hybrid modeling approaches. 

**Warning:** This journey might take a year or two
