# BioProcessML

Welcome to **BioProcessML**, a personal journey into the world of bioprocess modeling! This repository showcases my exploration of advanced machine learning techniques, including Gaussian Processes (GPs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), alongside hybrid modeling approaches. 

**Warning:** This journey might take a year or two

## About This Project

In this repository, I aim to develop predictive models for bioprocesses while incorporating professional MLOps practices. Each experiment and code snippet represents a step in my learning journey, emphasizing hands-on experience and practical applications.

## Technologies Used

### Machine Learning Techniques
- **Gaussian Processes (GPs)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs)**
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
- **Others**

### MLOps Tools
- **Logging**: For tracking experiments and model performance.
- **Docker**: For containerizing applications to ensure consistency.
- **GitHub CI/CD**: For continuous integration and deployment of models.
- **MLflow**: For managing the machine learning lifecycle.
- **DVC (Data Version Control)**: For versioning datasets and model files.
- **Apache Airflow**: For orchestrating workflows and automating tasks.


## Resources that are being used to study
- For Deep Learning: [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)
- For Deep Learning: [Aliceâ€™s Adventures in a
differentiable wonderland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17625) (This is condensed resource so need to make sure your basics are clear. I will start with the 'Dive into Deep Learning' and then go through this book to make sure I am not missing anything)
- For Maths (I have forgotten most of them so need some refresher): [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf) (I usually revise my concepts each time I come across maths that I can't decipher. This book can serve as a reference. I generally use other web resources tbh, but its to good to have a reference resource.)
- For ML: [PRML](https://www.youtube.com/@sinatootoonian9129)
I will have a notebook folder to keep all the notes of the things I have studied. I am following the first book (top-bottom approach).
